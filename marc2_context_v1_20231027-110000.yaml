metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  timestamp: "2023-10-27T11:00:00Z"
  
technical_state:
  goal: "Achieve functional audio playback"
  status: "SILENT PLAYBACK"
  blocker: "Hardware initialization failure. DACs not un-muted/output not enabled."
  tools: ["Ghidra", "RWEverything", "git"]
  environment:
    os: "Linux Mint"
    kernel: "6.8.0-64-generic"
  
  last_known_state:
    - Driver compiles and loads stably on the target kernel.
    - `aplay` runs for the correct duration but produces no sound.
    - The `kernel oops` in the IRQ handler has been identified but the final fix is pending.

  key_discoveries_from_video_analysis:
    - Start_Playback_CMD: "Write 0x0000EB00 to reg 0x00"
    - IRQ_Ack_CMD: "Write 0x00C0EB00, then 0x0000EB00 to reg 0x00"
    - Sample_Rate_Control: "Discrete values written to reg 0x04"
    - Playback_Counter_Addr: "Located at reg 0x14"
    - **CRITICAL_MISSING_STEP**: "A sequence of writes to the CODEC register (0x08) is required at playback start to un-mute the DACs."

  next_action_plan:
    - "Implement the discovered DAC un-muting sequence in the `.prepare` callback of the Linux driver."
    - "Use `mdelay` for timing, not `msleep`."
    - "Perform final playback test."
