# Collaboration Log & State Snapshot
# This document serves as a "restore point" for the AI-assisted modernization of the Quake 2 Classic project.
# It is maintained by //Mentor as a log of achieved milestones.
# This log specifically covers the successful, advanced refactoring of the entire sound system.

  project_identifier: "Q2C_AUDIO_REFACTOR_LOG"

  log_date: "2025-10-05" # End of the Audio Refactoring Phase

  collaboration_summary:
    objective: "To refactor the Quake 2 sound engine from a legacy, mutex-based 'pull' architecture to a modern, high-performance, lock-free 'push' architecture, eliminating thread contention and improving overall stability and performance."
    methodology: "A highly iterative, mentor-protege model. The AI mentor (//Mentor) provided architectural guidance and specific code blocks, while the human programmer (Fryziu) acted as the 'hands' of the projectâ€”integrating code, compiling, testing, and providing critical real-time feedback on performance and compiler outputs."
    status: "**OBJECTIVE COMPLETE AND EXCEEDED.** The project's sound system has been successfully refactored. The new engine is fully lock-free, utilizing a single-producer/single-consumer (SPSC) ring buffer for thread-safe communication. Issues of latency and audio dropouts have been resolved. The system is now more robust, modern, and performant than the original migration target."

  core_directives:
    # These principles, established during our interaction, governed the AI's operational conduct.
    - directive: "The John Carmack Ethos"
      description: "All proposed solutions must prioritize simplicity, clarity, and direct, robust implementation over complex or indirect alternatives."

    - directive: "The 100% Certainty Principle (The 'Ask, Don't Assume' Rule)"
      description: "If the AI lacks 100% certainty regarding the current state of the code, it MUST halt, state its uncertainty, and explicitly ask the human programmer for the necessary data before proceeding."

    - directive: "Evidence-Based Correction"
      description: "The AI must be able to pivot its strategy based on evidence (compiler errors, logs, user-provided code) and admit when a hypothesis is proven wrong. This was critical in debugging the final timing logic."

  achieved_milestones:
    - milestone: "Foundational Lock-Free Data Structure"
      description: "Designed and implemented a core SPSC (Single-Producer, Single-Consumer) ring buffer using C11 atomics (`stdatomic.h`). This created the cornerstone of the new architecture, allowing two threads to communicate without mutexes."
    - milestone: "Decoupling the Audio Callback (The Consumer)"
      description: "Refactored the SDL2 audio callback into a simple, passive 'consumer'. Its sole responsibility is now to safely copy pre-mixed audio data from the ring buffer, eliminating all complex logic from the time-critical audio thread."
    - milestone: "Creating the Game-Thread Mixer (The Producer)"
      description: "Relocated the entire audio mixing logic (`S_PaintChannels`) from the audio thread to the main game thread. A new function, `S_MixAudio`, was created to act as the 'producer', generating audio data in sync with the game state."
    - milestone: "Implementing Stable Buffer Management"
      description: "Replaced the initial, flawed time-based mixing logic with a robust 'target buffer level' model. This new approach ensures a constant, predictable audio latency and effectively eliminated both initial delays and subsequent audio dropouts."
    - result: "A fully decoupled, high-performance, thread-safe sound engine that is now a prime candidate for further modernization, such as the implementation of real-time DSP effects."

      description: "The sound system migration is complete. The implementation was elevated to a full architectural refactor, exceeding the original scope and delivering a superior solution."

      status: "**Next Up**"
      file_path: "src/client/snd_mix.c"
      item: "Implement DSP Effects (Low-Pass Filter for Occlusion)"
      description: "The current architecture is now perfectly suited for adding real-time audio effects. The `channel_t` struct contains unused fields (`occlusion`, `last_sample_l/r`) intended for this purpose."
      required_action: "Integrate a simple IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) low-pass filter into `S_PaintChannelFrom16` that is controlled by the `channel_t->occlusion` value, allowing sounds to be muffled dynamically."
