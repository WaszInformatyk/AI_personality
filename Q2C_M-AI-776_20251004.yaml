# Collaboration Log & State Snapshot
# This document serves as a "restore point" for the AI-assisted modernization of the Quake 2 Classic project.
# It is maintained by MentorAI as a log of achieved milestones and a ledger of outstanding technical debt.

  collaboration_summary:
    objective: "To incrementally migrate the Q2classic client from the deprecated SDL 1.2 library to the modern SDL2 library, ensuring each step is clean, understood, and adheres to a high standard of code quality."
    methodology: "An iterative, Socratic dialogue between a human programmer (the 'hands') and an AI mentor (the 'guide'). The core philosophy is the 'John Carmack ethos': prioritize simplicity, clarity, and direct, robust solutions over complex or indirect ones. Each step is a response to a specific compiler error, addressed systematically."
    status: "In Progress. The initial, most error-prone file (`rw_sdl.c`) is nearing a compilable state."

  achieved_milestones:
    - file: "Makefile"
      change: "Updated build flags from `sdl-config` to `sdl2-config` to link against the correct library version."
    - file: "src/linux/rw_sdl.c"
      changes:
        - "Resolved SDL1.2 symbol conflicts by updating key constant names (e.g., `SDLK_KP9` -> `SDLK_KP_9`)."
        - "Removed dependencies on deprecated SDL1.2 concepts (`SDLK_LAST`) and unused variables (`KeyStates` global array)."
        - "Replaced manual keyboard state tracking for Alt+Enter detection with the modern `SDL_GetKeyboardState` function, demonstrating a shift to SDL2's superior API."
        - "Resolved header file conflicts by using forward declarations for engine functions (`Sys_QueEvent`) and enums (`SE_KEY`) instead of including the monolithic `qcommon.h`, thus preventing symbol collision."
        - "Updated SDL subsystem initialization logic, removing the obsolete `SDL_INIT_CDROM` flag."
        - "Corrected function signatures and return types (`GLimp_Init`) to match their declarations in engine header files (`gl_local.h`), ensuring API consistency."

  technical_debt_ledger:
    # This section lists tasks that have been intentionally deferred to maintain momentum.
    # They must be revisited and properly implemented in the future.

      item: "SetSDLIcon function"
      description: "The legacy function `SetSDLIcon` and its call in `SWimp_Init` were commented out. It uses deprecated SDL1.2 functions (`SDL_SetColorKey` with `SDL_SRCCOLORKEY`, `SDL_WM_SetIcon`) that have no direct, simple replacement without a window handle."
      required_action: "Refactor to use `SDL_SetWindowIcon`. This will likely require passing the `SDL_Window*` handle to this part of the code, or, more cleanly, moving the icon-setting logic to a location where the handle is already available (e.g., `vid_so.c` during window creation)."
